# What Is Crimson OS?
Crimson OS is a linux distribution based up of the latest release of Raspberry Pi OS 64 Bit. Crimson OS is an operating system made for newcomers to linux to dwelve in the world of linux on their respective pi models. With limited resource usage and user-friendliness, we sought to provide a familiar experience to everyone. Furthermore, we have added different applications out of the box to enhance the experience of user and allow newbies to use them out of the box without the haste to search things online. 
The first release, Crimson OS - Auburn Autumn promises a great experience due to its extensive compatibility we achieved through forking various repos and branches.

# What Are Flavours Of Crimson OS?
Crimson OS comes in three different flavours, each having their respective pros & cons and respective usage:

_1.) KDE_
- KDE is a great desktop environment for everyone.
- With 500 MB of RAM usage on boot, it has been optimised for multi-tasking on the pi 4 and 5
- With user-friendliness everywhere in KDE, no newbie will be lost trying this desktop out.

  (Only To Show Vanilla Desktop - Actual OS May Vary)


_2.) XFCE_
- XFCE is a desktop environment for the higher pi models - starting from RAM 4 GB.
- Though XFCE is partially regarded as lightweight, it's regular updates are a matter of concern to say the least.
- Multi-tasking is not up to the mark but everyday things like watching youtube, listening music, creating docs is well suited for XFCE.

_3.) LXQT (Recommended By Crimson Team)_
- The overall best flavour among the three.
- Being lightweight, it doesnt occupy much RAM and any other resources.
- It's responsive and well suited for multi-tasking or any thing.
