Crimson OS is a linux distribution based up of the latest release of Raspberry Pi OS 64 Bit. Crimson OS is an operating system made for newcomers to linux to dwelve in the world of linux on their respective pi models. With limited resource usage and user-friendliness, we sought to provide a familiar experience to everyone. Furthermore, we have added different applications out of the box to enhance the experience of user and allow newbies to use them out of the box without the haste to search things online. 
The first release, Crimson OS - Auburn Autumn promises a great experience due to its extensive compatibility we achieved through forking various repos and branches.
